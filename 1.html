    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselectorall.asp" target="_blank"><strong>  Javascript</strong></a>(/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.<br> It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

<p>Alongside<span> HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span   class="js">Javascript</span> is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. <br> <span   class="js">Javascript</span> enables <u>interactive web pages</u> and thus is an essential part of<u> web applications</u>.<br> The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated <span   class="js">Javascript</span> engine to execute it.

</p><p>As a multi-paradigm language,<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript"> <strong>Javascript </strong></a> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.<br>It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

</p><p style="margin-top: 30px;">Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, <span   class="js">Javascript</span> engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make <span   class="js"> </span>available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

 Although there are strong outward similarities between <span   class="js">Javascript</span> and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; <span   class="js">Javascript</span> was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme. </p>
