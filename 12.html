<h2>Classes and objects</h2>
<p>Classes are the most fundamental of C#â€™s types. <br>A class is a data structure that combines state (fields) and actions (methods and other function members) in a single unit.<br> A class provides a definition for dynamically created instances of the class, also known as objects.<br> Classes support inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.

New classes are created using class declarations.<br> A class declaration starts with a header that specifies the attributes and modifiers of the class, the name of the class, the base class (if given), and the interfaces implemented by the class.<br> The header is followed by the class body, which consists of a list of member declarations written between the delimiters { and }.</P>
